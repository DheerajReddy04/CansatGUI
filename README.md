# CansatGUI
The GUI to display and visualize the telemetry data of the CANSAT when it is air-borne.

In the main.py, I have written the code for the project while AnalogGaugeWidget.py is an Open Source code I have
used to make the dials appear modern and good looking.

Thanks to Stefan Holstein, the creator of AnalogGaugeWidget.py code.

Thanks to StackOverflow community where I received constant support and ideas when I was stuck.
